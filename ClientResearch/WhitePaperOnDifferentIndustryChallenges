## Abstract
## Introduction
Research Questions:
1. What are the main methods of analysis, uses, and performance metrics of Data Science applied in Digital Marketing?
2. What are the areas of further research on the use of Data Science in Digital Marketing?

a. the marketing analytics literature offers little guidance on how digital marketing analytics tools should be selected and leveraged in service to the 
firm‚Äôs overall strategy.
b. to propose a conceptual framework that places use of digital marketing analytics tools and channels in the context of a firm‚Äôs marketing plan
c. help markers avoid falling victim to digital marketing analytics myopia, even as evolving technologies and broader societal forces like the response to 
Covid-19 accelerate the digitalization of marketing
d. It has been observed in this journal that "metrics and data are empty shells without proper theories and interpretations behind them"
e. key reasons for these failures are reliance on confusing and disparate planning frameworks, and focusing on tools, specific marketing metrics or 
financial returns instead of the consumer‚Äôs needs
f. The industry has its eyes so firmly on its own specific product that it does not see how it is being made obsolete.
g. Wells Fargo: these analytics tools were not employed to understand and create value from the consumer‚Äôs perspective, but rather to create value from 
the firm‚Äôs perspective. 
h. how digital marketing campaigns are destined to fail when marketers fixate on a key performance indicator (KPI) such as click thru rate (CTR)
i. AIDA (awareness, interest, desire, action) framework - how digital marketers usually do to attract customers, the track of movement (AIDA)
j. Shifted the focus from AIDA framework to the importance of consumer relationships.
k. McKinsey model: (1) begins with a list of brands they intend to consider, (2) adds or subtracts brands to the list as they evaluate what they want, 
(3) makes a purchase, and (4) builds expecta- tions based on their experience with the product or service to inform future behavior
l. What the existed analytics lack: offer little insights into the SEE stage of the journey model: do not track the list of brands consumers considering.
m. The frameworks are not intended to confine the application methods; in fact, the application methods are ought to be evaluated through the frameworks 
to be strategically promising.
n. Evaluating channel analytics should be viewed as an equation: Value (ùêï) + Sum of Channel Effectiveness (Œ£ùêúùêû) = Stage Outcome (ùêé)
o. Limitation: 
   1) it is merely conceptual and has not been tested by practitioners or researchers.
   2) have not attempted to address the appropriate timeframes and stage segmentation procedures for implementing the framework.

Industries have challenges.
## Methodology
As a start-up business, Cube Statistica is eager to develop by connecting with people in different industries, for expanding the business and learning
from the professionals. Although Cube Statistica has few experiences encountering in the biostats and health care industries, it strives to breaking into
other intriguing industries to obtain a better understanding of the market. To achieve, it is necessary to learn directly and primarily from industry
leaders about the powers and perils. Our team chose the largest professional networking platform - LinkedIn - to foster personal engagement with industry
professionals. In the meantime, our team re-positioned ourselves Cube Statistica as a statistical consulting company with data-centered services, leading
us to seek in those data-demanded industries to form a potential double_coincidence of wants. As a concession, our team will learn from different industries
to help us find the correct path. We plan to use one month for processing this market segmentation, hoping to summarize a concise report afterwards.

Fintech, is the first industry come into my head as it is hugely relied on data and relatively new compared to many traditional industries. Located in 
Toronto, the economic center of Canada, considerable numbers of Fintech businesses bloomed in the city branching in blockchains, e-commerce, digital
banking and more. Therefore, this state-of-the-art will be the first industry we start to tackle. To filter my LinkedIn search, I enter keyword 'Fintech'
and narrow down the location to 'Toronto, Canada' because we would like to dissect from the local businesses. The searched results have been filtered to
hundreds with the keyword and location. To demonstrate a warm regards, I wrote a message along with the connecting invitation, which briefly introduces
myself and the company, and most importantly, the purpose of connecting - to understand the industry from learning their weaknesses. Among the 35 persons
I have connected in the first day, one professional (sample remain anoynymous) replies my message very soon and presents a willingness of sharing his
experience with the company. We are all beyond thrilled to encounter the first potential client, who is about to lead us to his Fintech industry and
potentially is the one of our clients.

   [The dynamics and enthusiasm demonstrate by the first interviewee have set a tone for the primary engagement process. To encourage interviewee for
   profound responses and to enable ourself to better understand the market structure, the guiding question from me is ‚Äúwhat are some top challenges you or
   your industry have encountered, if solved, it will make a significant impact?‚Äù.

   According to the Fintech professional, the biggest challenge is the unestablished awareness of people with respect to Fintech concepts. When people 
   are unaware, they ignore or hesitate to the opportunity of breaking into Fintech in front of them. Meanwhile, the situation leads the insufficient
   consumer acquisition of Fintech businesses, deriving from the lack of awareness.
   
   Following that, the second biggest challenge is the conservative attitude of the government. The policies have impeded the Fintech industry to develop
   as speedily as in the United States. The challenge serves two ways of interpretations. On the one hand, the government can possibly as unaware as the
   public; on the other hand, the development of fintech industry is not suitable for the country of Canada.
   
   The third challenge is unexpected by me, as it is common and ubiquitous. The professional recounted that many consumer, or the general public, they
   serve often request unusual businesses that are not included in the Fintech services. A failure to meet these consumer's anticipation unleashes the
   condescending attitudes toward the professionals.
   
   Adding on to these, he introduced a situational challenge in Canada. Because the large immigrating population of Canada, of Toronto in particular, 
   many consumers are hoping to trade fiat money and crypto as convenient via fintech services. However, very few Toronto-local fintech services can
   successfully meet, so international consumers are hardly acquired and attained.
   
   Technically, fintech services often experience application crushdowns, failures of withdrawl and deposit, and transaction freezes. Moreover, as more
   new technologies break into the market, the fintech industry needs extra contribution in integrating systems to smooth the transformation.]
 
All five challenges are layout to represent the complexity and dimensions of the fintech industry, which definitely have helped our business practice to
identify certain weaknesses and threats under this industry. To bridge the industry with our business, another guiding question is threw to the 
professional: 'Cube Statistica is a company that creates machine learning applications, analyzes in the method of data pipelines, and eventually creates
dashboards which aim to give actionable insights. Do you think business organizations like us can resolve your challenges through our action?'. The short
answer from him is:
   
   [No.]
   
He explaines:

   [Maybe no, most of them are humanitary. About the government, and the people psychology. Technical knowledge. Data demonstration to help the public
   aware the industry. If your company can host workshops and lectures to use data to present the importance of Fintech, the effect of it will be more
   impactful than any analytical projects.]

The explanation is definitely reasonable according to the challenges he layouts at first. I present my genuine gratefulness toward him as an interviewee
for the project and a lecturer for educating me. 

Soon, more people accept my connect invitation but not many of them reply the message I sent along with the invitation. To optimize the time, I adjust my
tactics to first send out the connect invitation, then message them after accepting. This method improves from 2 aspects, because it makes a difference in
the relationship, from stranger to connection. Moreover, it saves the time as the list you are messaging is filtered as your connection. Lastly, it fixes
the flaws of people accepting invitation without reading message, leading to missing opportunities or sending redundant messages.

The second interviewee is from Marketing background, as she accepts my request to answer challenges in her industry and career path. Everything goes more
smoothly after my first practice. She raised a great point enlighten me to go on this research direction, that is: the transition from traditional
marketing to digital marketing. To specify, the digital marketing industry is excpetionally prevailing after the pandemic. Although none of the
professionals was used to it, they can no longer be working without digital marketing even after the pandemic recovery. However, as a relatively new
industry, marketing professionals are still required to put in substantial amount of effort to adapt into this digital era. Another minor challenge is
that the coordination of employees across the teams or even within one team. For example, in one marketing team, UX/UI designer can have a different
schedule timeline; meanwhile, graphic designers, social media specialists, they all have different timelines, in which involves communications in regards
of the multiple dimensions of marketing.

I throw the following question on my marketing interviewee about how can the use of data applications, what we provides, resolve challenges, and receive a
positive YES! I was intended to search for professionals from smaller businesses (<= 200), including her. She just moved to another large company, so she
does not anticipate that her company needs data application services from us. However, she offers few ideas that are talk with the business development
specialists because they are in charge of additional service to boost business efficiency, and look for CEOs in small businesses (<= 50), who have the
direct executive power over the company. In order to further realize the goal, which is seeking more clients, the last question to approach is that would
she or her company consider Cube Statistica to resolve their current challenges. Since she is await to be called for her next job, she is no longer in
the company on her LinkedIn profile. She smoothly turns my offer down but suggest to reach out to smaller businesses through certain filters that she
mentions above.

Plan of action: 
1. Collect the data
1. Positioned the environment of Cube Statistica as a statistical consulting company with data-centered services.
2. Conceptualized list of industries that are data-demanded to form a potential double-coincidence of wants.
3. Curtailed to fintech, digital marketing, and healthcare industries to further investigate.
4. Researched potential networks on LinkedIn platform entering curtailed industry keywords. 
5. Shifted to particular focus on small to medium sized businesses after receiving quality feedback from one respondent.
6. Identified the group of people who are the decision-makers (CEO, President, Vice President, Business Development etc.) from small to medium sized 
businesses, or at any  senior levels at work. More dimensions of experiences on career and industry challenges were expected to collect from this group.
7. Adjusted general network research by applying LinkedIn search filter "industry" and "service categories" to shortlist ideal networks with search 
keyword of titles (CEO, President, Vice President, Business Development etc.)
8. Phrased relevant messages to connected networks on LinkedIn.
9. Scheduled calls to responded networks (respondents) to learn from them.
10. Formulated spreadsheets to organize collected qualitative inputs.
11. Introduced qualitative inputs to data visualizer Tableau/SAP Analytics Cloud to form quantitative outputs.
12. Determined Digital Marketing strategies(optimize customers‚Äô preferences, tracking social media commentary/Interactions, analysis of online sales data, 
etc.)
13. Identified structured/unstructured data in the datasets and supervised/unsupervised learning in machine learning approaches to apply to Digital 
Marketing.
can be solved in means of Data Science.
14. Developed methodology to broaden the perspectives and approaches to statistical data analysis (descriptive statistics, Bayer's rule, method of least
squares, linear regression, logistic regression, artificial neural network, multivariate analysis, maximum likelihood estimate, discriminatory analysis,
information theory, artificial intelligence).
15. Concluded
16. Identified limitations

## Methodology
Plan of action: 2. Analyze and visualize the data
1. Downloaded Tableau as it is friendly to multiple servers.
2. Viewed Tableau tutorials to understand tool functions.
3. Performed similar tasks as in the tutorials to get hand-on experience.
4. Imported raw data collected.
5. Utilized data science acumen to develop assumptions on any dependent or independent variables.
6. Tested the assumption by entering relevant variables for analyzing.
7. Observed the graph until analyzable pattern appears.
8. Linked patterns with Research Question or market situation for bringing a broader view.
9. Facts should emerge from the data and actionable suggestions should be arise from data analytics.
