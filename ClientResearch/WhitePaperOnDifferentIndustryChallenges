## Abstract
## Introduction
Research Questions:
1. What are the main methods of analysis, uses, and performance metrics of Data Science applied in Digital Marketing?
2. What are the areas of further research on the use of Data Science in Digital Marketing?
## Purpose/goal
## How and why this is useful
## Conclusion
Industries have challenges.
## Methodology
1. Positioned the environment of Cube Statistica as a statistical consulting company with data-centered services.
2. Conceptualized list of industries that are data-demanded to form a potential double-coincidence of wants.
3. Curtailed to fintech, digital marketing, and healthcare industries to further investigate.
4. Researched potential networks on LinkedIn platform entering curtailed industry keywords. 
5. Shifted to particular focus on small to medium sized businesses after receiving quality feedback from one respondent.
6. Identified the group of people who are the decision-makers (CEO, President, Vice President, Business Development etc.) from small to medium sized 
businesses, or at any  senior levels at work. More dimensions of experiences on career and industry challenges were expected to collect from this group.
7. Adjusted general network research by applying LinkedIn search filter "industry" and "service categories" to shortlist ideal networks with search 
keyword of titles (CEO, President, Vice President, Business Development etc.)
8. Phrased relevant messages to connected networks on LinkedIn.
9. Scheduled calls to responded networks (respondents) to learn from them.
10. Formulated spreadsheets to organize collected qualitative inputs.
11. Introduced qualitative inputs to data visualizer Tableau/SAP Analytics Cloud to form quantitative outputs.
12. Determined Digital Marketing strategies(optimize customers’ preferences, tracking social media commentary/Interactions, analysis of online sales data, 
etc.)
13. Identified structured/unstructured data in the datasets and supervised/unsupervised learning in machine learning approaches to apply to Digital 
Marketing.
can be solved in means of Data Science.
14. Developed methodology to broaden the perspectives and approaches to statistical data analysis (descriptive statistics, Bayer's rule, method of least
squares, linear regression, logistic regression, artificial neural network, multivariate analysis, maximum likelihood estimate, discriminatory analysis,
information theory, artificial intelligence).
15. Concluded
16. Identified limitations
