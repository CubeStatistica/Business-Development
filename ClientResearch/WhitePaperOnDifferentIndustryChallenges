## Abstract
## Introduction
Research Questions:
1. What are the main methods of analysis, uses, and performance metrics of Data Science applied in Digital Marketing?
2. What are the areas of further research on the use of Data Science in Digital Marketing?

a. the marketing analytics literature offers little guidance on how digital marketing analytics tools should be selected and leveraged in service to the 
firm‚Äôs overall strategy.
b. to propose a conceptual framework that places use of digital marketing analytics tools and channels in the context of a firm‚Äôs marketing plan
c. help markers avoid falling victim to digital marketing analytics myopia, even as evolving technologies and broader societal forces like the response to 
Covid-19 accelerate the digitalization of marketing
d. It has been observed in this journal that "metrics and data are empty shells without proper theories and interpretations behind them"
e. key reasons for these failures are reliance on confusing and disparate planning frameworks, and focusing on tools, specific marketing metrics or 
financial returns instead of the consumer‚Äôs needs
f. The industry has its eyes so firmly on its own specific product that it does not see how it is being made obsolete.
g. Wells Fargo: these analytics tools were not employed to understand and create value from the consumer‚Äôs perspective, but rather to create value from 
the firm‚Äôs perspective. 
h. how digital marketing campaigns are destined to fail when marketers fixate on a key performance indicator (KPI) such as click thru rate (CTR)
i. AIDA (awareness, interest, desire, action) framework - how digital marketers usually do to attract customers, the track of movement (AIDA)
j. Shifted the focus from AIDA framework to the importance of consumer relationships.
k. McKinsey model: (1) begins with a list of brands they intend to consider, (2) adds or subtracts brands to the list as they evaluate what they want, 
(3) makes a purchase, and (4) builds expecta- tions based on their experience with the product or service to inform future behavior
l. What the existed analytics lack: offer little insights into the SEE stage of the journey model: do not track the list of brands consumers considering.
m. The frameworks are not intended to confine the application methods; in fact, the application methods are ought to be evaluated through the frameworks 
to be strategically promising.
n. Evaluating channel analytics should be viewed as an equation: Value (ùêï) + Sum of Channel Effectiveness (Œ£ùêúùêû) = Stage Outcome (ùêé)
o. Limitation: 
   1) it is merely conceptual and has not been tested by practitioners or researchers.
   2) have not attempted to address the appropriate timeframes and stage segmentation procedures for implementing the framework.

Industries have challenges.
## Methodology
As a start-up business, Cube Statistica is eager to develop by connecting with people in different industries, for expanding the business and learning
from the professionals. Although Cube Statistica has few experiences encountering in the biostats and health care industries, it strives to breaking into
other intriguing industries to obtain a better understanding of the market. To achieve, it is necessary to learn directly and primarily from industry
leaders about the powers and perils. Our team chose the largest professional networking platform - LinkedIn - to foster personal engagement with industry
professionals. In the meantime, our team re-positioned ourselves Cube Statistica as a statistical consulting company with data-centered services, leading
us to seek in those data-demanded industries to form a potential double_coincidence of wants. As a concession, our team will learn from different industries
to help us find the correct path. We plan to use one month for processing this market segmentation, hoping to summarize a concise report afterwards.

Fintech, is the first industry come into my head as it is hugely relied on data and relatively new compared to many traditional industries. Located in 
Toronto, the economic center of Canada, considerable numbers of Fintech businesses bloomed in the city branching in blockchains, e-commerce, digital
banking and more. Therefore, this state-of-the-art will be the first industry we start to tackle. To filter my LinkedIn search, I enter keyword 'Fintech'
and narrow down the location to 'Toronto, Canada' because we would like to dissect from the local businesses. The searched results have been filtered to
hundreds with the keyword and location. To demonstrate a warm regards, I wrote a message along with the connecting invitation, which briefly introduces
myself and the company, and most importantly, the purpose of connecting - to understand the industry from learning their weaknesses. Among the 35 persons
I have connected in the first day, one professional (sample remain anoynymous) replies my message very soon and presents a willingness of sharing his
experience with the company. We are all beyond thrilled to encounter the first potential client, who is about to lead us to his Fintech industry and
potentially is the one of our clients.

Plan of action: 
1. Collect the data
1. Positioned the environment of Cube Statistica as a statistical consulting company with data-centered services.
2. Conceptualized list of industries that are data-demanded to form a potential double-coincidence of wants.
3. Curtailed to fintech, digital marketing, and healthcare industries to further investigate.
4. Researched potential networks on LinkedIn platform entering curtailed industry keywords. 
5. Shifted to particular focus on small to medium sized businesses after receiving quality feedback from one respondent.
6. Identified the group of people who are the decision-makers (CEO, President, Vice President, Business Development etc.) from small to medium sized 
businesses, or at any  senior levels at work. More dimensions of experiences on career and industry challenges were expected to collect from this group.
7. Adjusted general network research by applying LinkedIn search filter "industry" and "service categories" to shortlist ideal networks with search 
keyword of titles (CEO, President, Vice President, Business Development etc.)
8. Phrased relevant messages to connected networks on LinkedIn.
9. Scheduled calls to responded networks (respondents) to learn from them.
10. Formulated spreadsheets to organize collected qualitative inputs.
11. Introduced qualitative inputs to data visualizer Tableau/SAP Analytics Cloud to form quantitative outputs.
12. Determined Digital Marketing strategies(optimize customers‚Äô preferences, tracking social media commentary/Interactions, analysis of online sales data, 
etc.)
13. Identified structured/unstructured data in the datasets and supervised/unsupervised learning in machine learning approaches to apply to Digital 
Marketing.
can be solved in means of Data Science.
14. Developed methodology to broaden the perspectives and approaches to statistical data analysis (descriptive statistics, Bayer's rule, method of least
squares, linear regression, logistic regression, artificial neural network, multivariate analysis, maximum likelihood estimate, discriminatory analysis,
information theory, artificial intelligence).
15. Concluded
16. Identified limitations

## Methodology
Plan of action: 2. Analyze and visualize the data
1. Downloaded Tableau as it is friendly to multiple servers.
2. Viewed Tableau tutorials to understand tool functions.
3. Performed similar tasks as in the tutorials to get hand-on experience.
4. Imported raw data collected.
5. Utilized data science acumen to develop assumptions on any dependent or independent variables.
6. Tested the assumption by entering relevant variables for analyzing.
7. Observed the graph until analyzable pattern appears.
8. Linked patterns with Research Question or market situation for bringing a broader view.
9. Facts should emerge from the data and actionable suggestions should be arise from data analytics.
